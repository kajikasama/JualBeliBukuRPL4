Synopsis:  There's a new face in town; hermit Kasen, whose most distinct feature is her tightly-wrapped injured arm.  More importantly, exactly who is Kasen, and why is she suddenly helping everyone out?  Is she really a hermit?  What's the secret behind her bandaged arm?  These questions and more are answered or are to be answered in the future.

Series Notes:  "Wild and Horned Hermit" is the current story arc of the "Touhou Ibarakasen" saga, and is still ongoing; it's one of the longest-running single storylines in the franchise, and remains one of the most popular to keep up with at the moment, alongside Forbidden Scrollery.
